## Homework Assignment 4

In this homework assignment I created a simple JavaScript Operator Quiz. It shows successive questions. Has a timer (including extra decrement for incorrect response). 

Known Bugs:
While this program does read, write and clear, the results from local storage, there is some bug which is causing it to be reset, and not persist. I ran out of time to debug, but I even had intermediate code which console logged the object correctly but would still get reset. 


The  primary areas for improvement in this project are:
- The four button click functions for the main code should be refactored into one. I was planning to substitue with jQuery but later learned this assignment needed to be done without using jQuery.
- Make it prettier using BootStrap.

The index.html, script.js and style.css pages provided are the only files.
